      <h1>What Do Dragonflies Eat? Diet Of All The Species Explained</h1>
      <h3>What do dragonflies eat other than insects?</h3>
      <p>Dragonflies eat insects. But it is also a well-known fact that dragonflies eat other dragonflies too. Apart from the other flying insects that they eat, what comprises the food of dragonflies?

        Dragonflies and damselflies are predators. They eat other insects that they catch, even if it is some species of dragonflies. It doesn’t matter if they are in the adult stage or larval stage; dragonflies and damselflies eat prey they catch throughout their life cycle. They serve a valuable purpose for humans by feeding on insects and mosquitoes.
        
        The larger species of dragonflies eat larger prey. A dragonfly can eat 15% of its own body weight. They eat prey depending on their size. The nymphs of dragonflies will eat small insects and other food like tadpoles, bees, and small fish.
        
        The adult will mainly eat flies and other insects and worms like butterflies, bees, midges, and mosquitoes that they catch. The nymphs have a bit more aquatic diet with tadpoles and small fish along with other flies.</p>
      <h3>What do red dragonflies eat?</h3>
      <p>What do red dragonflies eat? Is their diet the same as that of other species of dragonflies?

        Red dragonflies eat a variety of insects. Their prey list includes various flying insects and worm species. The adult dragonfly of this species eat flies, ants, mosquitoes, butterflies, and other dragonflies. The nymphs in their larvae stage eat insects in the water, which includes tadpoles, fish eggs, small fish, and larvae of mosquitoes.
        
        Both the adult dragonfly and the nymph of the dragonfly are carnivores in nature. Larger dragonflies have larger prey, while the nymph will have comparatively smaller prey like fish eggs and larvae of other insects like mosquitoes. Different species of dragonflies, like red dragonflies, are not so different in their feeding habits from most dragonflies.</p>
      <h3>Do dragonflies eat roaches?</h3>
      <p>We have discussed that dragonflies are carnivorous animals. They can eat insects that are similar to them in size. They will hunt for whatever insects that they can catch and devour. Where do roaches come in this scenario?

        Do dragonflies eat roaches? Roaches are not part of the general diet of the dragonflies, but cockroaches are part of the flying insects and may attract dragonflies. There are only very few insects that adult dragonflies won’t eat.
        
        This happens mainly if they are larger than the dragonflies. Once a dragonfly eyes an insect, they will hunt them down. Baby dragonflies start with smaller insects and eggs. Once they are adults, eating a roach is not a big problem for these species. If they can catch the insect, they will eat the insect. Simple as that.</p>
