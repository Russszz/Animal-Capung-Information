      <h1>Dragonfly habitats</h1>
      <h3>Where do they live?</h3>
      <p>Of course, we were looking in the right kinds of places to find them. 
      </br>
        1. Near Water
        This is not the only place to see dragonflies and damselflies. The adults, and particularly the females, fly away from water to hunt and only return to creeks and lakes for breeding. Males, however, tend to hang about near water, staking out territories and waiting for females to arrive. 
      </br>
        2. Different types of water
        Different species favour different water bodies. Their larvae are variously adapted for still, sluggish or fast-flowing water. Some species are quite opportunistic, while others have very particular requirements.</p>
      <h3>Habitat 1: the pond</h3>
      <p>An artificially natural pool </br>
        Constructed during the Winter of 2016, our small frog pond is already quite an established ecosystem. It has been through various phases, including an early period when it was home to masses of voracious diving beetles.</br>
        
        At the moment it is teeming with tadpoles.</p>
        <p>Although not a naturally occurring pond, we largely allow nature to run its course. </br>

           1. We don’t clean it.  At times it develops quite a thick algal growth, but then that dies off and the water clears again. Who knows what accumulated debris now covers the sandy bottom of the central ‘deep’ zone?!</br>
            
           2. And we haven’t introduced any animals to it, apart from whatever might have hitched a ride on the pots of water plants we placed in the middle. Importantly, we’ve never introduced any fish, and none have found their way in. The pond is quite a distance from the nearest freshwater stream, and being on a high part of the block, it doesn’t receive any creek overflow.</br>
            
            It is best described as a ‘shallow, permanent pool’. Our one exception to this hands-off approach is that we’ve never allowed it to dry out completely. We do let it drop about 300mm in depth, but then we usually relent and add a few hundred litres of tank water. </p>
